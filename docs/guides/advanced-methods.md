# Advanced Methods

Use these patterns when you want faster execution, reliable context handoff, and clean multi-agent collaboration.

## Chain the full goal lifecycle

Use this sequence to move a goal from definition to completion with clear checkpoints:

```bash
> jumbo goal add --objective "..." --criteria "..." --scope-in "..."
> jumbo goal refine --id <goalId> --interactive
> jumbo goal commit --id <goalId>
> jumbo goal start --id <goalId>
> jumbo goal submit --id <goalId>
> jumbo goal review --id <goalId>
> jumbo goal approve --id <goalId>
> jumbo goal codify --id <goalId>
> jumbo goal close --id <goalId>
```

Tips:

- Use `jumbo goal update-progress --id <goalId> --task-description "..."` after each meaningful sub-task.
- If QA finds issues, use `jumbo goal reject --id <goalId> --audit-findings "..."`, fix, then `submit` again.
- `jumbo goal qualify --id <goalId>` exists for backward compatibility but is deprecated in favor of `goal approve`.

## Run multiple agents in parallel safely

Jumbo supports concurrent workers in separate terminals.

Recommended pattern:

1. Terminal A starts one goal: `jumbo goal start --id <goalA>`
2. Terminal B starts a different goal: `jumbo goal start --id <goalB>`
3. Each terminal updates progress on its own goal as work completes.
4. Pause one worker without affecting others using `jumbo work pause` and later `jumbo work resume`.

Rules for low-conflict parallel work:

- Assign non-overlapping scopes when creating goals.
- Keep goals small and vertically sliced.
- Submit frequently so review/codify can run while implementation continues elsewhere.

## Use work-level pause and resume for continuity

`work pause` and `work resume` operate on the current worker's claimed goal.

Use them when:

- You need to compress context before handing work off.
- You need to switch priorities without losing current execution state.
- You want the next session to reload the right goal context automatically.

## Keep context quality high with lightweight habits

To get the most out of Jumbo:

- Register decisions when architectural choices are made: `jumbo decision add ...`
- Register guidelines/invariants when user corrections define standards.
- Keep component and dependency records current before starting large goals.
- Use `jumbo session start` at the beginning of every agent session so orientation is consistent.

## Recommended rapid workflow

For day-to-day execution:

```bash
> jumbo session start
> jumbo goals list --status defined,refined,doing,paused
> jumbo goal start --id <goalId>
# implement in your coding agent
> jumbo goal update-progress --id <goalId> --task-description "..."
> jumbo goal submit --id <goalId>
```

Then proceed with review, approval, and codification as needed.
