 * - StartGoalCommandHandler → StartGoalContextView (adds start-specific prompt)
 * - ReviewGoalCommandHandler → ReviewGoalContextView (adds review-specific prompt)
 * - etc.
 *
 * This maintains clean separation of concerns per CQRS:
 * - Query layer: retrieves data
 * - Command/Presentation layer: enriches for specific use cases
