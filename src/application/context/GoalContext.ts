 * GoalContext - Core relation-based context for a goal.

 * - Goal (core entity)
 * - Relations (edges in knowledge graph)
 * - Related entities (fetched via batch readers)
 *
 * All arrays are guaranteed non-null and contain no null items.
 * Related entities include relation metadata (type + description)
 * to provide context about WHY the relation exists.
 *
 * Callers can map this to specific views:
 * - StartGoalContextView (enriched with LLM prompts)
 * - ReviewGoalContextView (enriched with review-specific data)
 * - etc.
