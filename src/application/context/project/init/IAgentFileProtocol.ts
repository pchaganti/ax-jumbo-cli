/**
 * Port: Agent File Protocol
 *
 * Defines interface for managing AI agent instruction files and configuration
 * during project initialization.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Ensure AGENTS.md exists with Jumbo instructions
 * - Ensure all supported agents are configured
 * - Report planned file changes for preview before execution
 *
 * Design Notes:
 * - Operations are idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
 * - Side effects only (no domain events emitted)
 * - Errors logged but don't fail initialization (graceful degradation)
 * - Agent-specific knowledge is encapsulated in individual Configurer classes
