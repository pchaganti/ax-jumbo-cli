/**
 * SessionStartContextView - Complete data model for session start orientation
 *
 * This view encapsulates all the data needed to render the session start
 * context packet. It follows CQRS principles by providing a single cohesive
 * read model that the presentation layer can render.
 *
 * The application layer assembles this view from multiple projection stores,
 * keeping the presentation layer free from repository orchestration concerns.
 *
 * Contents:
 * - project: Project context (name, purpose, tagline)
 * - audiences: Target audiences for the project
 * - audiencePains: Active pain points being addressed
 * - latestSessionSummary: Historical context (what was worked on previously)
 * - inProgressGoals: Current active work (goals with status='doing')
 * - plannedGoals: Available work (goals with status='to-do')
