/**
 * SqliteGoalRejectedProjector - SQLite projector for GoalRejectedEvent.
 *
 * Implements IGoalRejectedProjector for projecting goal rejected events

 * Clears claim fields when rejecting (review complete, claim released).
 * Stores review issues in the dedicated reviewIssues column for the implementing agent to reference.
